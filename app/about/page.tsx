        <h1>Extension intelligence built around exact evidence.</h1>
        <p>
          GuardRails is an independent security product for evaluating IDE
          extensions before installation and following their published releases
          afterward.

          <h2>What the product does</h2>
          <p>
            It retrieves an exact published artifact, combines deterministic
            static analysis with bounded Bubblewrap runtime observations when
            the artifact requires them, and keeps both evidence types on the
            same report. Findings, coverage, artifact identity, scanner build,
            ruleset, and runtime limitations stay attached to that release.
            Unsupported or failed runtime coverage is visible; it is not
            converted into an allow.

          <h2>What can be verified</h2>
          <p>
            Analysis Reports expose the version and SHA-256 boundary. The
            validation study publishes its corpus, regression results,
            corrections, and claim limitations.

          <h2>What is not claimed</h2>
          <p>
            GuardRails does not claim that every allowed extension is safe, that
            a capability proves malware, or that the development benchmark
            measures ecosystem-wide accuracy.

          <h2>Supported through Sarvam AI&apos;s Startup Program</h2>
          <p>
            GuardRails has been accepted into the Sarvam AI Startup Program.
            We&apos;re working with Sarvam AI through its Startup Program to make scan results easier to read. The guide helps with three common questions: Should I install this? What should I do about a flagged release? How should I answer a publisher? The scan remains the source of truth, and the guide says when it does not have enough information.
