            to 25 seats; billing has not opened yet, and early-access users

            Billing is not enabled, so nothing on this page can be purchased
            today. When it opens, Monitoring is $19/month and Teams is $99/month
            for up to 25 seats. Anyone who joins early access before then keeps
            those prices, gets two months off on annual billing, and is covered
            by a 30-day money-back guarantee.
