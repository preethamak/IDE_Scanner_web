  {
    q: "Does this upload my code or my installed extensions?",
    a: "No. The website analyzes published marketplace packages in isolated runners. Installed extensions are inspected locally by the GuardRails CLI, and imported report files never leave your browser.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if the analysis is wrong?",
    a: "Every report keeps its scanner build, ruleset, coverage, and limitations attached, so you can see exactly how far a result goes. Incomplete analysis is shown as incomplete — it is never converted into an approval.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much work is this for my team?",
    a: "Public reports need no account. Monitoring watches your extensions automatically and only notifies you on meaningful capability changes, so review effort goes to releases that actually changed behavior.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does it cost?",
    a: "Scanning is free. Monitoring is $19/month and Teams is $99/month when billing switches on — early customers keep those launch terms, annual billing takes two months off, and every paid plan carries a 30-day money-back guarantee.",
